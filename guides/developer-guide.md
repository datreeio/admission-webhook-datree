# Developer Guide

This guide explains how to set up your environment for developing on webhook-datree.  
This guide was written for macOS and Linux machines.

## For developing on a local server with thunder client (faster build)

### Prerequisites

- Go version 1.18
- Git
- **optional**: [gow](https://github.com/mitranim/gow#installation) (go file watcher)
- **optional**: VS Code + Thunder Client

### Running webhook-datree as a local server
```
make start
```

### Alternatively, use watch mode for hot reload ðŸ¤©
```
make start-watch
```

### Then make requests using Thunder Client
- GET /health
- POST /validate (webhook-demo.yaml)

## For developing on minikube (slower build)

### Prerequisites

- Go version 1.18
- Git
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#minikube)

### Background processes that need to run:
- Run `minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.enable-admission-plugins=ValidatingAdmissionWebhook`
- Run Docker daemon by opening Docker desktop

### Deploy to your local minikube
- Run `make run deploy-in-minikube` - this will build a docker image and deploy it to minikube
- check the webhook is deployed: `kubectl get pods -n datree`
- try to apply a demo file to the deployment: `kubectl apply -f ./scripts/webhook-demo.yaml`

### Remove from local minikube
```
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

### Deploy and apply webhook-demo.yaml to minikube
```
make run-in-minikube
```

### Run a basic E2E test (Not currently in CI)
this will apply the webhook-demo.yaml file to 
minikube and compare the output to ./internal/fixtures/webhook-demo-expected-output.txt
```
make test-in-minikube
```

### Build the docker image locally
```
./scripts/build-docker-image.sh
```
