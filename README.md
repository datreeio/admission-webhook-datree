# Datree admission webhook

## Overview

Datree offers cluster integration that allows you to validate your resources against your desired policy upon pushing them into a cluster, by using an admission webhook.  
The webhook will catch kubectl **create**, **apply** and **edit** operations and initiate a policy check against the resource/s associated with each operation.  
If any violations are found, the webhook will reject the operation, and display a detailed output with instructions on how to resolve each violation.

## Installation
